# Brainstorming Stackathon project: 

Tiny Desk Player (working title): A website that allows you to put in your mood (alone or with group / desired genre of music / happy sad upbeat chilled out / whatever else) and it will generate the NPR Tiny Desk YouTube video that you should watch. The website will allow a queue to form, leaving it up to YouTube's splendid algorithm to take care of the tunes. 

Will set up a database with links and tags for each video 
A Youtube will be rendered into the website 
No way to skip ads but skip to the end of the video and play again to skip ads :) 

Should I make this a desktop app? 

# NEW IDEA 
Mobile app - choose a mood, narrow it down to 4 
Generates a Youtube playlist of Tiny Desks for said mood
