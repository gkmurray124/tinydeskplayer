# About TinyDeskPlayer
This is my submission for Fullstack Academy's Stackathon project, a 4-day solo assignment meant to challenge our skills and learn something new. 
I watch NPR Tiny Desk videos all the time, whether I'm with friends or by myself, in a mellow or upbeat mood, and regardless of what genre I want to listen to. I love how these artists and their music can influence the environment no matter what you're doing. 
I created a mobile app where a user can choose a mood and then it generates a playlist of NPR Tiny Desk videos related to that mood. All playlists are created by me. The four moods include: 
    Funky 
    Mellow
    Good Beats
    R&B 
I also created a Surprise Me button on the app that plays a random Tiny Desk from one of these playlists. 

# Developing TinyDeskPlayer
I used React Native to develop my app and I'm using YouTube API to access a YouTube player within the app. The most challenging part for me was learning to develop in React Native while trying not to sacrifice anything from my original idea. I was not able to use Youtube's react-native package as it is unfortunately broken (as of 3/14/2020) and resorted to using webview instead, which takes a source link and opens it in the same window.
